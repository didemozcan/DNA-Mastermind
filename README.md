# DNA Mastermind Game

## Overview

The DNA Mastermind game is a fun and educational Python-based game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated DNA sequence. The game provides players with a sequence of 5 nucleotides (A, T, C, G) and asks them to guess the correct combination within a limited number of attempts. Players receive feedback after each guess, including information about correctly guessed positions (X), nucleotides included in the sequence but not in the correct position (W), and non-included nucleotides (-).

## How to Play

1. **Getting Started**: Run the Python script `dna_mastermind.py` to start the game.

2. **Game Rules**: Follow the on-screen instructions to understand the game rules. Players can input their guesses in CAPITAL LETTERS.

3. **Guessing the Sequence**: Input your guess for the DNA sequence. The game will provide feedback on each guess.

4. **Winning**: If you correctly guess the DNA sequence, the game will congratulate you and display the number of attempts it took to solve it. You can choose to play again by pressing 'R' or quit by pressing 'Q'.

5. **Wrong Guesses**: If your guess contains incorrect nucleotides or is not the correct sequence, the game will inform you about the mistakes and deduct from your remaining attempts.

6. **Quitting the Game**: At any point, you can quit the game by typing 'Q'. You can also restart the game by typing 'R' after successfully guessing the sequence.

## Features

- Random generation of DNA sequences for endless gameplay.
- Interactive gameplay with feedback on each guess.
- Option to restart the game or quit at any time.
- Educational value for learning about DNA sequences and nucleotides.
